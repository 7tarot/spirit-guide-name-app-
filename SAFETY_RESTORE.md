**If you see a blank page:** your `index.html` may have been a placeholder. Replace it with this one.

Deploy steps
1) Unzip this package.
2) Copy **index.html** to your repo root (overwrite the old one).
3) Ensure your audio file exists at **ambient/binaural.mp3** (make the folder if missing).
4) Commit & push → Netlify → **Deploys → Clear cache and redeploy**.
5) On the live site: **Enable sound** → Demo → Calculate → choose a voice → Test voice → Play.

This build includes: read‑all narration + disclaimer, true Stop, Force English toggle, voice test, ambient volume slider, email/consent to Apps Script, 24‑hour countdown, and restored classic UI.
