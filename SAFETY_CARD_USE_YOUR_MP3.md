# Use Your Own Ambient MP3 — Classic UI
Date: 2025-09-04

Works with your Ableton export.

**Two easy ways to use your audio:**
1) Put your file at `ambient/meditation.mp3` (recommended). It will appear as a ready option.
2) Or choose **➕ Upload custom file…** and pick any audio from your computer (plays locally without uploading).

**Deploy steps**
1) Put `index.html` at the repo root (replace current one).
2) If using option 1, ensure your MP3 is at `ambient/meditation.mp3`.
3) Commit & push → Netlify: Deploys → Clear cache and redeploy.
4) On site: click **Enable sound** once → pick your track → enjoy.

Narrator voices come from the visitor’s device. Select one and press **Play**.
