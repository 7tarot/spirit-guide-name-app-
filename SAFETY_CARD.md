## Restore (GitHub Desktop)
1) Open your repo → **Repository → Show in Explorer**.
2) Copy these two files into the repo root (same level as `style.css`).
3) Back in GitHub Desktop → **Commit** (“restore: matrix theme + voice selector”) → **Push origin**.
4) Test your Pages URL in **incognito**. If it looks cached, add a tiny comment to `index.html` and push again to force a rebuild.
