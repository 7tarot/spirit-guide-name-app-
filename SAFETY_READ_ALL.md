# Read‑All Narrator + Single Ambient Track
Date: 2025-09-04

- Narrator now **reads EVERYTHING**: preamble, guide name, snapshot numbers, and all long descriptions.
- Preamble says: “This is a general overview… Google Sheet captures name/DOB with consent… email follow‑up is more precise.”
- Ambient menu has **only one option**: `ambient/binaural.mp3` (your Rhino Beat). No other WAV/MP3 options shown.
- Demo fills both **name** and **DOB**.

**Deploy**
1) Replace your `index.html` with this one at the project root.
2) Ensure your Ableton track exists at `ambient/binaural.mp3`.
3) Push → Netlify **Deploys → Clear cache and redeploy**.
4) On the live site: **Enable sound** → **Demo** → **Calculate** → **Play** to hear the full narration.
