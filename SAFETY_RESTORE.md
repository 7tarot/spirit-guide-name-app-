This updates your homepage to add:
1) Clean paragraphs for numerology cards (visual only).
2) A "Synchronicity" floating button (opens in new tab).
3) Default narrator voice preference (Google UK English Female → UK Male → US).
4) A "Copy full reading" floating button.
5) Email/Sheet health tick that goes green after a successful Apps Script POST.

## Install
1) Open your repo in GitHub Desktop.
2) Drag **index.html** into the **root** (same place as your current index).
3) Commit → Push.
4) Verify the button top‑right, try "Copy full reading", and submit once to see the green tick.

If anything looks odd, revert the commit in GitHub Desktop to return to your previous version.
