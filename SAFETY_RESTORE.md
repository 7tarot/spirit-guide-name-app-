# SAFETY_RESTORE

This bundle restores your **Spirit Guide App** main page and keeps the **Synchronicity Reader** as a separate page.

## Files in this bundle
- `index.html` — your Spirit Guide App (restored).
- `synchronicity.html` — the Synchronicity Reader (v4.5.0 Variation Packs).

## How to install (drag + drop)
1) Open your repo folder in GitHub Desktop.
2) Drag BOTH files into the **root** of the repo (same place as before).
   - If you get “replace?”, choose **Replace** for `index.html` to restore your main app.
   - `synchronicity.html` is new and won’t overwrite the main app.
3) Commit and Push.
4) Visit:
   - Main app: https://spirit-guide-name-app.netlify.app/
   - Synchronicity: https://spirit-guide-name-app.netlify.app/synchronicity.html?v=var450
